# Lightweight Scripting Language Project

## Introduction
The Lightweight Scripting Language Project provides a simple yet powerful solution for working with mathematical expressions. You can input expressions involving basic arithmetic operations, variables, and assignments. The project will parse and evaluate these expressions, allowing you to perform calculations, manipulate variables, and analyze mathematical relationships.

## Compiling the Program
To compile the program:

Navigate to the project root directory 

Open a terminal or command prompt

Type: `make`

## Running the Program
After compiling, you can run the program as follows: `./program < input.txt`

Replace `input.txt` with the path to your input file which should be in the root directory. The program will parse and evaluate the mathematical expressions in the file.

To run the program in a one-liner, run `make && ./program < input.txt`

## Using the Executables
`program`: This is the main program executable. It accepts and processes input files containing mathematical expressions. You can use it to perform calculations, assign values to variables, and more.
